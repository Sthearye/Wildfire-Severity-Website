# Wildfire Severity Prediction

**A concise summary of the repo (e.g., What is this repo?).**
This is the repository for the CS163 final project, California Forest Fire Prediction, created by Sokuntheary Em and Devin Chau. We aim to analyze the key drivers of wildfires in California based on their county in the hopes of reducing them in the future. Through a website, we were able to display our findings and visualizations of what we found!
